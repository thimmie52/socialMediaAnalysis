This contains all the files used in my analysis of the diceytech hackathon - Hack The Feed: Insights From Social Media Data

#### Project
This project was done in partnership with Playground Communications to analyze and gain insights from the data of one of their high profile clients- Stanbic IBTC.<br>
This repository contains the `ipynb` file which was used to perform cleaning and transformations.<br>
It also contains important files like the `report` in pptx format, the dashboard for visuals in `Pbix` format.<br>
